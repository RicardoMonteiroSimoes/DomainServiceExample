# DomainServiceExample
This is suppoed to end up being an example of a full stack project that uses kubernetes, and a variety of other tools, to build, test and deploy it all.

The idea is very simple. Create a full repository that contains a fullstack environment. This fullstack environment consists of a frontend, a backend and a database. These services are to be split up into their respective domains, containerized and deployed using kubernetes. They should involve and use concepts that are _young_ in nature but proven to be usable, for example in bigger production environments.
